                        <h2>2022/23 Season Review</h2>
                        <p>It's been a dream season for the Mets. Scherzer is doing what Scherzer does, dominating. And rendering the fact we lost a Norse god in the offseason wholly irrelevent.. Sorry Thor</p>
                        <p>Jacob Degrom and Doc Gooden may have thrown the same amount of pitches in Citifield this year by July, and we may still be in first place! :: Lebron Chalk Toss :: </p>
                        <p>Don't wanna jinx it but looks like our young guys are getting more steady. Baty, Alvarez, Mauricio.. We see yall</p>
                        <p>Bassitt is straight balling. Glad we avoided arbitration and got the option for next year</p>
                        <p>Cohen could run for Queens Borough President and legitmately win with all he's done for this team so far. Only Action Bronson, Nas, and Joe Douglas could do this off clout alone. Yeah I said it! Get the JD statue ready! </p>
                        <p>Supposedly a house I rented in college one semester, Darryl Strawberry rented as well. It had a alot of glass/marble features.. Now why would someone need so many smooth surfaces?? Cant wait to see him in a Mets Uniform</P>
                        <p>Lindor is my guy fam. That coming to america pic alone was enough. homie bought in to the culture</p>
                        <p>I shit talked thru 7 different topics of Mets baseball without mentioning, the Polar Bear, Our HomeRun King, White Jesus, yupp.. WHite Jesus. Pete Alonso</p>
                        <p>Okay, white Jesus may have been a bit much but I was a runner/server at the Sheraton in Denver when the MLB all stars stayed for All Star Week and he won the Derby, and his folks were so nice!!</p>
                        <p>that Canha signing might be my favorite after the pitchers. guy just gets on base. I hear the dude with amazing hair from Moneyball going nuts in my ear. You tell him chubby Jonah. We miss you in these streets</p>
                        <p>Side note: Does covid even happen in the multiverse where Gucci never got cloned in jail and chubby Jonah still exists? Deep down, i know this is the best timeline. Shoutout to that one Community episode with the dice</p>
                        <p>"It's Troy and Abed in the morning!" IYKYK. and if you dont, you wasnt sposed to. this may not be the space for you and thats okay</p>
                        <p>while we here and reppin' queens, that spiderman with all the spidermen of spidermens past shit was awesome. They all bring they own flavor to it. But im taking the multiverse with Zendaya in it 100/100 times.. sorry MJ</p>
                        <p>:: Kanye Voice :: Andrew had the best performance as a side spiderman in a spiderman movie not featuring his multiverses spiderman.. EVER!! ROFL</p>
                        <p>I haven't mentioned the Mets in 5 lines. Can you see why school was hard for me? Okay done here. See yall over on the Jets side. WOOOOOO!!!</p>
                        <p>PS. It's 830 am, and i havent even had coffee yet. Sings in best Beyonce voice "I WOKE UP LIKE THIS!!!" </p>
                        <p>:: single ladies dance ::</p>
                        <p>ideally a gif would go there if I dont get lazy</p>
                        <p>ok im done for real now</p>
