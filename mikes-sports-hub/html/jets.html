            <p>In JD We Truss!</p>
            <p>Saleh Slander is an executionable offence round these parts</p>
            <p>Speaking of executing and offense?? La Fleur had ppl stealing our plays for playoffs with practice squad talent out there. just wait...</p>
            <p>Beefy thicc Zach still looks 16, but you hear him in these press conferences.. my man is barking a lil louder these days. turn the swag on fam</p>
            <p>Breece is my favorite pick. If that O-line is what I think it can be.. sheesh is he gonna be hard to get hands on</p>
            <p>if Moore, Wilson and Davis can be anything like Lavernues, santana and chrebet.. we gonna be a problem </p>
            <p>Sauce and Reed the best CB duo we had since Revis and Cromartie. Big Facts! Gotta love the depth of pinnock, riley, davis, etc </p>
            <p>Clemons, Myers, Q, JJ, Lawson, Martin are gonna be hard to keep up with play after play.. dont sleep</p>
            <p>We come out those first 4 games, 2-2 with some close calls vs the Ravens and Bengals and its on</p>
