			<p id="description">Legend has it that centuries ago, a treaty was formed between the Unicorns of Etherea and the Buffaloes of Colorado to create a new species of community-oriented, magical, fantastical animals: the Bufficorn.

The Bufficorns (monocerus magicalis bisonae) embody the best of both worlds. They #BUIDL for positive-sum outcomes and encourage the expression of unique creativity by each member of the community.</p>
